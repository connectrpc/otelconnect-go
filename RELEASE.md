# Releasing otelconnect-go

This document outlines how to create a release of otelconnect-go.

1. Clone the repo, ensuring you have the latest main.

2. On a new branch, open [otelconnect.go](otelconnect.go) and change the
   `version` constant to an appropriate [semantic version](https://semver.org/).
   To select the correct version, look at the version number of the [latest release]
   and the changes that are included in this new release.
   ```patch
    const (
   -     version             = "0.10.0-dev"
   +     version             = "0.10.0"
         semanticVersion     = "semver:" + version
   ```
   This usually entails just removing the "-dev" suffix, but if only a patch release
   release is warranted, but the "dev" version implied a minor version, then set the
   minor version back, for example `1.1.0-dev` -> `1.0.1`. If a release candidate is
   warranted, use an appropriate suffix.

3. Open a PR titled "Prepare for vX.Y.Z" ([Example PR #200](https://github.com/connectrpc/otelconnect-go/pull/200))
   and a description, tagging at least one current maintainer. Once it's reviewed and
   CI passes, merge it.

   *Make sure no new commits are merged until the release is complete.*

4. Using the Github UI, [create a new release](https://github.com/connectrpc/conformance/releases/new)
   like so:
   * Under “Choose a tag”, type in “vX.Y.Z” to create a new tag for the release upon publish.
     Note: The release job does infer the version from the release string and expects versions
     to start with `v` (e.g. `v0.1.0`).
   * Target the main branch.
   * Title the Release the same as the tag: “vX.Y.Z”.
   * Click “Set as latest release”.
   * If this is a release candidate, or any other kind of pre-release, click "Set as a pre-release".
     A pre-v1.0.0 number, like "v0.3.0", should not be marked as a pre-release.
   * Set the last version as the “Previous tag”.
   * Click “Generate release notes” to autogenerate release notes.
   * Edit the release notes.
      * Tweak the change description for each if necessary so it summarizes the salient
        aspect(s) of the change in a single sentence. Detail is not needed as a user could
        follow the link to the relevant PR. (Potentially take a pass at PR descriptions
        and revise to increase clarity for users that visit the PRs from the release notes.)
      * Related commits can be grouped together with a single entry that has links to all
        relevant PRs (and attributes all relevant contributors).
      * A summary may be added if warranted.
      * The items in the list should be broken up into sub-categories. The typical
        sub-categories to use follow:
         * **Bugfixes**: Self-explanatory -- fixes to defects. These can be bugs in the
           test runner or bugs in the reference implementations.
         * **Enhancements**: New features or additions/improvements to existing features.
           This can include new command-line flags to enable new functionality and also
           includes addition of test cases for enhanced test coverage.
         * **Other Changes**: Other noteworthy changes in the codebase or tests. Use your
           best judgement when deciding if something warrants appearing here. Things like
           dependency updates and the like do _not_ warrant appearing here and should be
           removed from the auto-generated release notes.
   * Click "Save Draft" and then share the link to have the notes reviewed by at least one
     other [maintainer](https://github.com/connectrpc/conformance/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).
   * After the notes are approved (after some potential iteration and revision), you can
     finally create the release by clicking "Publish Release".

5. On a new branch, open [otelconnect.go](otelconnect.go) and change the
   `version` to increment the minor tag, zero the patch number, and append the `-dev` suffix.
   Use the next minor release - we never anticipate bugs and patch releases.
   ```patch
    const (
   -     version             = "0.10.0"
   +     version             = "0.11.0-dev"
         semanticVersion     = "semver:" + version
   ```
   If you just created a release candidate, you should anticipate another candidate
   before final release. In that case, use the same version number as the release
   and increment the candidate number.
   ```patch
    const (
   -     version             = "1.0.0-rc4"
   +     version             = "1.0.0-rc5-dev"
         semanticVersion     = "semver:" + version
   ```

6. Open a PR titled "Back to development" ([Example PR #201](https://github.com/connectrpc/otelconnect-go/pull/201)).
   Once it's reviewed and CI passes, merge it.
